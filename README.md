# SQL_PROJECT

In this project you will find 5 common databases used in different fields of activity.
These are for a bowling league, entertainment agency, recipes, sales order and school scheduling. 
I used PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 to establish communication between the server and the GUI. 
In each folder you will find 4 files, one is the schema which helped me to rapidly find the query I need to make to fetch the information I need and 3 SQL file which are the scripts to load the tables, the data and the query I create as views in other database server. 
You need to run the scripts in a specific order. First, the structure file which creates the schemas, the tables and the constraints for each table and last but not least the views of the queries I've made.
